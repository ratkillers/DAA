  <h2>Algo</h2>
  <pre>
    J: Array of N jobs
    D: Array of the deadline for each job
    P: Array of profit associated with each job
    
    // Output : Set of scheduled job which gives maximum profit
    
    Sort all jobs in J in decreasing order of profit
    S ← Φ	// S is set of scheduled jobs, initially it is empty 
    SP ← 0	// Sum is the profit earned 
    for i ← 1 to N do
      if Job J[i] is feasible then
        Schedule the job in the latest possible free slot meeting its deadline.
        S ← S ∪ J[i]
        SP ← SP + P[i]
      end
    end
  </pre>
   <h2>Word Algo</h2>
   <pre>1) Sort all jobs in decreasing order of profit. 
    2) Iterate on jobs in decreasing order of profit. For each job, do the following: 
    a) Find a time slot i, such that slot is empty and i<deadline and i is greatest. Put the job in 
    this slot and mark this slot filled. 
    b) If no such i exists, then ignore the job.
    </pre>
  <h2>Time</h2>
  <pre>Simple greedy algorithm spends most of the time looking for the latest slot a job can use.  On average, N jobs search N/2 slots. This would take O(N2) time.

    However, with the use of set data structure (find and union), the algorithm runs nearly in O(N) time</pre>
